                Forced to go rogue. Hunted from within. This is Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6.
            </p>
            <p>
                Developed by Treyarch and Raven, Black Ops 6 is a spy action thriller set in the early 90s, a period of
                transition and upheaval in global politics, characterized by the end of the Cold War and the rise of the
                United States as a single superpower. With a mind-bending narrative, and unbound by the rules of
                engagement, this is signature Black Ops.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Black Ops 6 Campaign provides dynamic moment-to-moment gameplay that includes a variety of play
                spaces with blockbuster set pieces and action-packed moments, high-stakes heists, and cloak-and-dagger
                spy activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your city never rests. Like any living, breathing world, it changes over time. Some changes will be slow
                and
                gradual, while others will be sudden and unexpected. So while seasons turn and night follows day, be
                ready
                to act when life doesn't go to plan.
