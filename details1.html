            <p>
                Raise a city from the ground up and transform it into the thriving metropolis only you can imagine.
                You've never experienced building on this scale. With deep simulation and a living economy,
                <strong>Cities:Skylines II</strong>
                delivers world-building without limits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lay the foundations for your city to begin. Create the roads, infrastructure, and systems that make life
                possible day to day. It's up to you – all of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                How your city grows is your call too, but plan strategically. Every decision has an impact. Can you
                energize
                local industries while also using trade to boost the economy? What will make residential districts
                flourish
                without killing the buzz downtown? How will you meet the needs and desires of citizens while balancing
                the
                city's budget?
            </p>
            <p>
                Your city never rests. Like any living, breathing world, it changes over time. Some changes will be slow
                and
                gradual, while others will be sudden and unexpected. So while seasons turn and night follows day, be
                ready
                to act when life doesn't go to plan.
            </p>
            <p>
